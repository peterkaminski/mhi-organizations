# SMART Criteria

SMART criteria help define well-formed goals.  As originally stated:

> Ideally speaking, each corporate, department, and section objective should be:
> 
> -   _Specific_ – target a specific area for improvement.
> -   _Measurable_ – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
> -   _Assignable_ – specify who will do it.
> -   _Realistic_ – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
> -   _Time-related_ – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.
> 
> Notice that these criteria don't say that all objectives must be quantified on all levels of management. In certain situations, it is not realistic to attempt quantification, particularly in staff middle-management positions. Practicing managers and corporations can lose the benefit of a more abstract objective in order to gain quantification. It is the combination of the objective and its action plan that is really important. Therefore serious management should focus on these twins and not just the objective.
