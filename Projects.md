# Projects

An Actor accomplishes its [[Purpose]] with a fractal, hierarchical set of Projects that accomplish work that accrues to the Actor's stated Purpose and Commitments.  Sometimes an Actor is referred to as a project.

Projects are similar to Actors in that they have a Purpose, but they are _not_ autonomous; they are managed and regulated by the Actor in which they are situated.

Projects are internal to an Actor, but have Inputs, Outputs, and Status that may be reported or connected to other Projects in other Actors.
