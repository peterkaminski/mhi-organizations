# Massive Decentralization

**Comments welcome!** Click the "**<**" icon in the upper right of the page to annotate/comment with [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/).

**Massive Decentralization** maps one of a number of possible cooperating architectures for human-centered decentralization and federation. Since decentralization itself must be decentralized, we believe this is one way, but not the only way, to decentralize.

Massive Decentralization is part of the [Massive Human Intelligence Project](https://massivehumanintelligence.org/), which is organized by [Peter Kaminski](mailto:kaminski@istori.com).

We propose the following (draft, 2022-06-04):

- A [[Network]] is composed of coordinating Actors.
- [[Actors]] are autonomous and self-governing individual humans, or groups of humans.
- Actors publish statements of [[Purpose]] and [[Principles]]. They write their own statements or declare agreement with those of another Actor.
- Actors [[Federate]]:
	- Actors communicate about their Purpose and [[Projects]], and the statuses thereof, in simple formats defined by the Network.
	- Actors make [[Commitments]] with other Actors and strive to keep them.
	- Actors request guidance from other Actors when they want to coordinate or overcome blocks to progress.
	- Actors are willing to be listed in the Network'sÂ directories.
