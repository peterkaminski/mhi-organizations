# Network

A Network is the collection of cooperating [[Actors]]. It is an emergent thing, created out of the missions and actions of each and every Actor as all the Actors interact with each other and the world.

A Network delegates (or in another way of speaking, is comprised so that) almost all of the functions that coordinate Actors are fulfilled by Actors.

That is, there is _very_ little overhead function in the Network; Actors perform overhead functions on behalf of the Network, rather than any centralized individual or group.

Actors themselves will have internal overhead functions, or will outsource them to other Actors, as do any other sorts of organizations, but generally the Network will not have its own overhead functions.
