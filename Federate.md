# Federate

The Actors in the Network Federate by communicating about their Purpose and Projects, and the statuses thereof, in simple formats defined by the Network.

Actors make [[Commitments]] with other Actors and strive to keep them.

Actors request guidance from other Actors when they want to coordinate or overcome blocks to progress.

To be part of the Network, Actors are willing to be listed in the Network'sÂ directories.
